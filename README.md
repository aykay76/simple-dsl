I was looking on my bookshelf and saw 'Writing Compilers and Interpreters, An applied approach using C++' by Donald Mak.

I remember using this to write a DSL for 3D modelling and thought it would be fun to bring it up to date a bit using C#. As it happens I'm looking to write a DSL for something so it's kind of why I was looking at my bookshelf :)

This is the first step of creating a parser that executes a DSL using a simple stack to maintain temporary variables and expression results etc.

I have just finished the complete Pascal parser from the book and may upload that once I have removed my comments and mistakes. Converting from C pointer arithmetic to C# class hierarchies, and also making it language independent has introduced some complexity, but hopefully it's worth it.
